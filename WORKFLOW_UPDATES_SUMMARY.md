# Workflow Updates Summary

## âœ… Complete Review Done

I've reviewed both GitHub Actions workflow files against the latest 2024/2025 documentation and best practices using web search.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated All Actions to Latest Versions

| Action | Before | After | Reason |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| actions/checkout | v4 | **v5** | Latest stable release |
| actions/setup-python | v4 | **v5** | Latest stable release |
| actions/upload-artifact | v3 | **v4** | v3 deprecated (June 2024) |

**Sources verified:**
- https://github.com/actions/checkout/releases
- https://github.com/actions/setup-python/releases
- https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact

### 2. Added Required Permissions

**generate-article.yml:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write  # Required for git push
```

**Why:** GitHub Actions tokens are read-only by default. Git push needs explicit write permission.

### 3. Enabled Pip Caching in Test Workflow

**test-environment.yml:**
```yaml
cache: 'pip'  # Enable pip caching for faster runs
```

**Why:** Speeds up test runs by caching dependencies. Main workflow already had this.

## Verification Sources
