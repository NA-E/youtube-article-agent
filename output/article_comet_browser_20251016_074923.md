# Perplexity Comet Changed How I Use My Mac

I'll be honest, I didn't get the hype about AI browsers. But after using Perplexity Comet for a full week, I am all in. And I'm about to show you not just 10, but over a dozen real-world use cases that make Comet an invaluable part of my workflow.

I've tried multiple browsers. I tried DIA, Google Chrome with Gemini, and even ChatGPT agent mode. None of those are as capable as Perplexity Comet on taking action on websites. I'm going to show you specific examples of finding promo codes for websites, incredible use cases for YouTube and finding clips, quickly finding files on websites that may be difficult to navigate, analyze data and metrics quickly, and how it's completely changed how I use my Mac.

Before diving in, it's worth noting that you can use Comet in two ways after installing the application. First, the main chat window is good when you need to run more complex multi-step agentic tasks. The second way is through the assistant sidebar, which is perfect for quick contextual tasks within your current web page.

Now, for those of you already writing a comment about security and privacy, I'll address that at the end of the video. But first, let me blow your mind with some use cases.

## What Makes Comet Different: A True Personal Assistant

As Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas explains, "Comet is not just a browser. It's meant to be your true personal assistant." The key insight here is that when you hire an assistant or anyone to join your team to help you with tasks, you take it for granted their ability to use the internet - their ability to use search, web browsing, and all the tools that exist on the open web. 

"That's not something you can take for granted with an AI," Srinivas notes, "because the model is obviously giving it reasoning capabilities, but AI is clearly going to only deliver value as an end-to-end, orchestrated system that knows how to use the browser, how to upload files, how to download them, how to pull context from relevant tools and data that's only relevant to you and nobody else."

This fundamental difference is what makes Comet so powerful - it's not just answering questions or being a chatbot. It's truly about delivering value and being able to delegate tasks to it. The future, as Srinivas describes it, is "AIs that are just doing work for you, even as you sleep, without you even asking for it."

## Use Case 1: Finding Promo Codes That Actually Work

Yes, no more looking at those shady websites where you have to click or put in your email. I'm actually going to do a side-by-side comparison because you can ask ChatGPT to find promo codes as well and I have it in agent mode right now. The problem is it can't actually test those promo codes live in your cart.

So, for this website, which is notoriously hard to find promo codes for, here I am at the website in the cart and the Perplexity browser can actually see the discount code form field and I just prompted to find a promo code that's going to work, but keep trying them until it actually goes through.

As you can see, a lot of times promo codes, even that the AI finds, might not work, but the difference is Comet can actually try them here in the cart until it's accepted. And that quickly, it already found a discount code that actually worked. It was able to put it in, click apply, and now it's going to look to see if there's any better deals.

But ChatGPT in agent mode, which I actually had started on this task minutes ago, is still looking. I'm actually going to pull up a second website. This is Overstock. And give it the same prompt to find a discount code.

And that's another powerful feature of an AI browser. I can leave it running a task in one tab, open a new tab, and start again. And some of the use cases I'm going to show you, you might say, well, I can do that faster. But yeah, you have to focus on that task and do nothing else to do it faster. Perplexity Comet can just do it in the background while you start doing something else.

ChatGPT agent is still working in the background, and by the way, ChatGPT finally gave me some promo codes for this website and most of them fail. It did find one that worked for 10% off, but as you saw, Comet did it in seconds and ChatGPT took 11 minutes.

## Use Case 2: Incredible YouTube Capabilities

Perplexity Comet can do incredible things when it comes to YouTube. For instance, I can prompt it to play the exact time code where Neil Armstrong says "one small step for man" and play that clip on YouTube.

So, when I give Perplexity Comet that prompt, it's actually going to find a YouTube video where he says that and then start playing at the exact time code. And you see it open the tab there. It's playing that quickly. It was able to find the exact moment I was looking for.

And it doesn't even have to be that specific. I'm going to ask it to find a part of a Steve Jobs keynote where he talked about Apple being at the intersection of liberal arts and technology. When I give it that prompt, it's going to go look through many different keynotes, find a clip, and boom, that quickly. Now I have the moment where Steve Jobs talks about that. And if I wanted to pull this as a clip, maybe use it in a documentary style video, it's that easy to find.

Not only that, but it can take action on videos that you're watching live on YouTube. So, I'm watching this Sarah Dichi video about her setup. And maybe I want to ask a question and just find out what camera is she using. It'll go through the captions or the transcript that the video provides it. And there you have it. It told me that Sarah's using the FX3.

I can ask it about different pieces of equipment. Or I can even ask it for timestamps like "tell me where in this video she talks about the audio setup and microphones." And that quickly gives me a time stamp 12:46 and I can jump to it.

You can also ask it general questions which you can do this with the DIA browser as well. But you can ask it for actionable tips on making YouTube video intros from an interview that you might be watching like this Colin and Samir video and I get those points right here side by side as I'm watching. Then I can ask for timestamps and then I can jump to the part of that conversation where they discuss the tip.

And let's say you were watching my recent iOS 26 video with 100 plus features. I'll link that video above by the way. If you wanted to say get the thumbnail for the video, I can just ask the browser that and there it pulled the raw thumbnail image from the page code and I can save that image to the computer.

You can even ask it to find videos and add them to a playlist. So I'll give it that prompt and it will literally search YouTube for me, find videos and automatically add them to my playlist. Now this use case specifically is a little hit and miss. It's not super accurate, but it can search for the keynotes in the YouTube search bar. It will find what looks like the full length keynote and then try to add it to my playlist. It does take a while, but again, you can leave this running in the tab and do something else.

## Use Case 3: Live Marketing Intelligence Agent

Competitor analysis often means drowning in tabs and manually copying data into files. But Comet can analyze multiple competitor sites live simultaneously and extract the key insights. For example, when doing a live competitor analysis for Gamma, I have the Gamma website and other competitors' websites open. What makes Comet so cool is that it can retrieve all the contexts across different browser tabs.

I can just type in the prompt and ask it to do the analysis for the open tabs and not just the homepage but also dig into all the key pages in the process. It's amazing that it's performing all the live analysis for you, browsing all the competitive pages. You can always double-check the latest screenshot to see which page it's analyzing. This process will save you lots of time that used to take hours and now it can take as quick as 15 minutes.

What's more, we can now ask it to create this report into a new Google document. Even on Perplexity you can export to Word documents, but now with Comet you can literally export any research findings to your Google Workspace when you have linked up your account.

## Use Case 4: Advanced Research Agent

We all know the pain of research: dozens of cluttered tabs and information chaos. Comet can turn that mess into an organized workspace, letting the agent read everything at once to deliver powerful insights.

Usually when we do research we have so many tabs open and they look very cluttered. A cool way is to ask Perplexity to group relevant tabs into what it calls a dedicated workspace as it can understand the context for all the open tabs. You can make everything so organized, and to resume any research project just pick the workspace again from the navigation bar.

When you're in the research workspace, you can let it read and analyze all the open pages. For instance, I can ask it to identify the top three to five common themes across these sources and implications. It can save you lots of time navigating different open tabs.

Here's a bonus: you can click to save this prompt into a shortcut command with your defined instruction. You can even pick the search mode and models. So every time you can just type this command and it will execute for you. Another bonus is fact-checking. Often times when you're researching and reading articles, you see different claims. What makes Comet useful is you can now just copy the text and then ask the agent to do an initial fact-checking for you.

## Use Case 5: Streamlining Amazon Product Lists

A lot of times I have products that I want to make into a list and it can be difficult to get the Amazon links and get a nice title because even shortcuts, which I love and use all the time, if it pulls the raw title from an item listing, it's going to be a long messy title.

But if I have a bunch of Amazon tabs open here in my browser, I'll prompt Comet by saying "take all the Amazon tabs in this window, get a short URL, format the product title, and then put it in this format: Product name, link, and so on and so forth." Now, I can go off and do something else.

But side note, an incredible utility now that I'm using more AI browsers and prompts, Text Expander is invaluable. I have a whole list here of prompts now that I'm using with both Comet and ChatGPT. And it's nice to just be able to do a little string of text and then the prompts fully expand and I'm good to go. If you've never used Text Expander or just the keyboard shortcuts built into Mac, highly recommend trying it with prompts.

And here's a full list of all those Amazon products. Comet actually shortened the name so you just have the brand and what it is plus shorter Amazon URLs. That would save me a long time right there.

## Use Case 6: News Synthesis and Database Updates

Perplexity is especially good at doing real-time search or finding timely sources. We can build a news synthesizer agent that finds the most important weekly news and automatically updates your central database, making sure everything is automated.

Let's say I have a Notion database called weekly AI/SEO news that is used to store different AI/SEO news updates. I can just ask Perplexity Comet to find me the top five most important AI SEO news from the past week and help me update to this Notion database. I can even try using the deep research mode.

It is really cool to see it researching and updating the Notion database for you, entering each of the news items. Within 10 minutes you can have this structured news database sorted by date. And it doesn't have to be news items. It can be any findings that are useful for your projects.

This is helpful if you want to repurpose the content or have a newsletter that captures the latest trends where you can consolidate everything in one knowledge hub. You can even set up a scheduled task to have it run on a weekly basis and it will pop up the billing task created for you. This way you're fully maximizing the automation power of the Perplexity agent.

## Use Case 7: Automated Publishing for Apple Podcasts

This is a niche use case, but Perplexity is the only thing that can do it. When I upload subscriber audio to Apple Podcasts, meaning you pay for the bonus episodes and ad-free versions of Primary Technology, which by the way is my tech podcast with Jason Aten, you should totally subscribe new episodes every week. I'll link it above and down in the description.

But Apple Podcasts, when I upload that subscriber audio, I have to wait for it to process in order to click the publish button. It is maddening. Apple should really just let you say "publish when audio is processed" so I don't have to sit here and babysit it, but I don't have to anymore because Perplexity Comet will babysit it for me.

So I have a prompt where I tell it "refresh this browser every minute and once that publish button turns purple, publish the episode." There's been sometimes where I forgot to publish the episode just because I'm having to sit here and refresh the browser. But now Perplexity can do it for me and then it automatically clicks publish when it's ready.

That was actually the first use case I discovered and I use that every day because we do a Primary Tech daily episode.

## Use Case 8: Lead Monitoring Agent

Staying informed is one thing, but what if we can now shift from consuming information to generating opportunities? We can have a lead monitoring agent that sources forums for high-intent questions and automatically emails you summaries of qualified leads.

Let's say I run an SEO agency or service business. I can just set up this task for Perplexity agent to ask it to search the relevant subreddits for high intent SEO questions in the past seven days and to give the criteria what signals the agent should look for which should be all signals of buying intent, and then summarize the lead details and send an email to me.

The agent is doing its job digging through the Reddit forums and filtering threads according to our defined criteria. It finds qualified leads and seeks my approval to send the email. You can just hit send and then immediately you will receive this email with all the details like the post name, the pain point, the rationale why this is a qualified lead with the source link.

Of course you can take a step further to also let the agent draft the reply and post it for you, but I would highly prefer just doing it yourself and really provide genuine advice. And now the best thing is you can just schedule this task to run on a weekly basis. So it's just like a mini lead monitoring engine that helps you look for high intent leads or conversations on Reddit or whatever platforms that you want. You can even use it to track your brand mentions as well.

## Use Case 9: Finding Files on Complex Websites

Perplexity is great at finding PDF or other file URLs that might be on a website, so you don't have to go looking and searching. Yes, you could do a site search in Google, but if I was here on the IRS page, I can just ask it something like, "Get me the W9 PDF from this website," and I'm just on the homepage. I'm not on anything special, and in just a few seconds, it's going to find that form, and I can just download it. Boom, there's the link right here. I can click it. There's the PDF.

This is also really useful for obtuse government websites, like a DMV website. So, I can ask it "what documentation do I need for a new tag or registration on my car." And so, it'll just automatically tell me right here based on this web page and other sources it's found. But because it can just load pages for me, I'm going to ask it "bring me to the page on this website with that information."

And then, Comet can just bring me to the page on the DMV website that has all the info I need. You can see it literally navigating the website, clicking around, finding the page, and now I'm on the page I need to be. So, I can browse and actually read the info in context.

## Use Case 10: Sales Prospecting Agent

Finding high-intent leads is a great start, but we need to act on that. We can create a sales prospecting agent that finds potential companies that match your ideal customer profile and drafts hyper-personalized outreach emails directly in your mailbox.

The first way is to ask Comet to find a list of prospecting companies for your outreach process. You provide the criteria about the ideal companies that you want to work with, like in this case e-commerce businesses and their revenue growth, hiring signals, company size, and ask Perplexity agent to collect the relevant details and the sources to focus on.

Now the agent will trigger the search and filter those companies that match the criteria, which is something only an agent could do, and then identify the potential companies to reach out to. Note: I didn't ask it to collect emails as I found it can be difficult for Comet to grab the right email for now. So instead you can use LinkedIn Sales Navigator or Apollo to find and verify the emails.

Another way Comet can help is once I identify the contact list, I can just tag it for the agent and then have it draft the personalized email by doing the research, which can take a lot of time, and then use the email formula that I provide. The coolest thing is that you can just ask it to save this email as a new draft on your Gmail. So they are ready for your final approval and sending. Imagine if you have 10 to 20 of them - you can use the same method and streamline the whole process.

## Use Case 11: Analyzing Website Metrics and Data

Whether it's website analytics and metrics or maybe podcast downloads, Comet can just analyze the information from a website and then you can just ask it questions. So here I am on Transistor and I can ask it "what's our second highest downloaded episode of this podcast" and it will look at the information, browse whatever part of the site it needs and it just tells me the episode right here.

I can also ask it "what month in the last year had the most downloads." And if you use things like Google Search Console or Google Analytics on a website, sometimes it can be hard to get the exact information you want, but you can just ask Comet to do it. And it even had to download a CSV file, but it was able to do it. Change the date range. And now I have my answer.

Now, speaking of metrics, we can go back to YouTube and Comet's actually great at analyzing YouTube metrics here in advance mode. As you can see, it's actually changing the date range here in advance mode to get the last 6 months. And just like that, it found which month had the highest watch hours and told me how many.

Then it can even format data that you're asking about into a table. And just that quickly, now I have a table with all the data from my YouTube studio.

## Use Case 12: Audience Research Agent

Targeted outreach is effective, but the best marketing comes from deeply understanding your target audience. We can turn Comet into an audience research agent and have it dig through social media for real customer pain points for your marketing asset building.

Let's say I'm an agency owner and I want to understand what are the small business owner challenges when building a website. I can turn Comet into an audience research agent and really navigate to Reddit or YouTube for real audience quotes.

You can see Comet is browsing the subreddit sites, doing the actual searching on Reddit, analyzing each thread, which is why we need an agent. This is super cool to see Perplexity agent really digging through the comment sections on YouTube as well. This used to eat up lots of time or you need to set up an API.

Now it generates all the real audience quotes for you with the category and with the top three pain points identified. You can just download it and import it back to Google Sheets, which I found is better for now. Then you can take this analysis for all the strategy actions like creating your messaging, brand kit, offerings, persona profiles.

A bonus is now you can even take this audience research and switch to Perplexity Labs and then ask it to build an HTML landing page for you, so the language used is really resonating with your target audience.

## Use Case 13: Google Sheets Integration

So I just copy and pasted that markdown table that I had from Comet. And now I can ask it for formulas based on the data in this sheet. For instance, I can ask it "what's the average watch time from this data." And it knows what this data is because it's looking at the website. And boom, it can give me the average.

But I can even ask it to help me with formulas to insert into the spreadsheet. I'll just ask it for a simple formula that calculates the sum total from a specific column. It gives me the formula I need to do. So I can just copy paste that here in the spreadsheet and I'm done.

And this can help you build even more advanced formulas in spreadsheets. I can't take as much action on spreadsheets that I would like. I'm sure that's coming in future updates. But just being able to give me formulas or just give me answers about the data I'm looking at, that's pretty great.

## Use Case 14: AI Search Content Analysis

Once you know your audience pain points, you need to create content that answers those questions. And every marketer knows now that AI search, especially Google's AI Overviews, is a big one. So how can Perplexity Comet agent help with that?

For example, I can go to Google's AI Overviews and then ask Perplexity agent to analyze the AI search results for me about the patterns that I observe or any best practices we should follow from those top AI search results. In this case it's "AI for small business."

I think that is one of the best ways to use Perplexity agent because even ChatGPT agent has no access to Google's AI Overviews. You can see it is smart enough to expand all the cited search results and dig through them one by one. This saves you lots of time analyzing yourself and doing the reverse engineering.

Then it comes up with a detailed analysis about what are the common patterns for these search results, and we can even ask it to generate the SEO content brief for this topic. You can repeat the same process for any high-intent search queries for AI search and it will save you tons of time.

## Use Case 15: Superior Website Search

Searching for specific content on a website is just better in Comet. So this is our podcast website for Primary Technology and I know there's transcripts for every episode and maybe I could do a site colon and search through Google but I can just ask Comet "what are some of the episodes listed on this site where we talk about the Mac Studio" and it's going to look through all the pages of the website and find it like Google would.

That quickly it already told me which episodes it is but then I can tell Perplexity to just navigate to the page of the episode that it was describing and there we go we already got brought to it and it even went to the transcript and because it's going to be a long website, I can ask it "find in the transcript where we start talking about the Mac Studio" and now it jumped to that specific part of the transcript and that's because it can control the website here in the browser which is different than just having a chatbot off to the side.

## Use Case 16: Conversion Optimization Agent

As marketers, we all know that conversion optimization is really important as it directly impacts your bottom line. So let's build an agent to identify all the frictions in your sales funnel. But instead of just giving some big prompts, there is a better approach.

Let's say we're doing a conversion optimization audit for a health supplement e-commerce brand. I already have a process document about how to perform the audit with step-by-step what steps to take and with all the details from product discovery all the way to checkout flow.

Now on Perplexity Comet, I can just reference back this process document in the open tab and ask it to follow it when doing the auditing and then to repeat the same for competitors. This will save you lots of time because imagine you just need to create any process document once and then you can just ask the agent to follow that.

It is following the instructions in the process document to search for the specific product and add to the cart and repeating the same for all the competitors. Then it will give you really detailed analysis of what are the identified issues across different buying journeys for you and the competitors and propose the five top priority fixes. This works not just for e-commerce - it can also be used for any websites with a sales funnel like a SaaS business, service business, or even just a personal website.

## Use Case 17: LinkedIn Contact Discovery

If you use LinkedIn or if you're trying to find contacts on the platform, I actually saw Joanna Stern of the Wall Street Journal tweet about this where she used Perplexity Comet to great effect to find people. So, I'm going to ask Comet to find someone who used to work on the AI team at Apple, but now works at Meta, and then navigate to their profile here in the browser.

And there's the profile here on LinkedIn. And yeah, sure enough, he's worked at Google, Apple, and now Meta.

## Use Case 18: Talent Sourcing Agent

Sometimes your project might need partners or you might need the right people to grow. We can let Perplexity be a talent sourcing agent and search job platforms using your detailed criteria, and this will be a huge timesaver. The concept is not just for talent sourcing - it can also be used for finding service providers or guest speakers as well.

For example, I'm looking for an overseas talent that specializes in SEO, and I know OnlineJobs.ph is well known for searching different online marketing specialists. I can ask the assistant to find 10 qualified candidates with the specified criteria like years of experience, tools proficiency, skills, salary expectations. Basically you list every important criteria for your project.

The agent will start doing the heavy lifting for you. This process usually takes up lots of time, and it's amazing that Perplexity agent is trying to dig through each profile's details and see if that's a good match and help me find the qualified candidates. Finally it helps me identify the 10 qualified candidate profiles with a ranked summary table, and I can click on each one to read the details or take follow-up actions.

Of course you can even ask the agent to contact the candidate on your behalf, but for now, I still prefer contacting myself for this kind of high-stakes action. You can even ask the agent to expand the search to find if these candidates are active on social media or have a personal site to gauge their culture fit.

## Use Case 19: Executive Assistant Agent

We can connect Comet to your Google Workspace and have it act as an executive assistant researching your prospects, scheduling meetings, or handling all those admin tasks.

One of the immediately useful ways is to ask Perplexity to prepare you for meetings. Often times you might have external meetings with prospects or vendors or partners. Just ask Perplexity to check your calendar for external meetings and research each company or person, their background, key people, recent updates.

The agent will compile everything into a Google document with each company in separate tabs and it summarizes what they do, recent news, key executives, and conversation starters. So you are fully prepared for your meetings.

Another way is scheduling. Let's say I want to find the top 10 marketing conferences happening in the next six months. I can ask the agent to first search for these events and then take that list and add each one to my calendar with the title, location, and description. It will prompt me to approve each event creation so I can review them one by one, or you can just ask it to schedule directly with approval. Then each event will be added to your calendar with the event link.

This aligns with what CEO Srinivas describes as the future of AI assistants: "It's auto drafting your responses to emails that were sent while you were not even active on your device. It's scheduling your meetings on your behalf and moving things around even without you asking for it. And it's prioritizing your emails that are sent to you."

## Use Case 20: Automated Property Search

So those were many useful use cases, but let me give you a bonus one just for fun. If you were searching a site like Zillow, maybe for a house, you can use the built-in search and then try to filter those search results manually. But you can also just type what you're looking for in Comet and then it will do all the filtering for you.

Now again, is this faster than you actually doing it? No. But I can go do something else while it's doing this in the background. And yeah, it's found a bunch of houses in Lakeland, Florida under $400,000 with at least four beds, three baths. And again, I could have done those filters quicker myself, but I didn't have to wait around and click all those things myself. I could just let Comet do it for me.

## The Technical Architecture Behind Comet

Understanding what makes Comet work helps explain why it's so powerful. As CEO Srinivas explains, "Building something like Comet requires orchestration of several different models. One model that truly reasons, one model that pulls context, one model that synthesizes and processes them. Another model for like computer use, like capabilities to actually go and control websites or tools."

This multi-model approach is what enables Comet's sophisticated capabilities. "We see the future as something where people don't - I mean, we've been saying this even in the era of just AI answering questions where no one even cares what models are being used for what purposes, as long as this end-to-end system does what the user wants."

The key innovation is that Comet doesn't need to store all your data to be effective. "You don't need all the emails to be stored in an index," Srinivas notes. "The magic of all these tools is they can pull whatever context is necessary on demand and ignore everything else." For example, if you're asking it to prepare you for your day, it just needs to pull the calendar events for that particular day and the emails that have been unread on top of your inbox for the last day or two, but not your entire inbox history.

## Privacy and Security: A Balanced Approach

I know privacy is a big hesitation when it comes to Perplexity AI browser. I think first we all need to understand that for an AI browser to be useful and effective, it needs context from browsing and that means it has to access to a certain extent of the data. Though I can see that Perplexity Comet does collect more data by default.

But there are ways you can minimize this risk. First, you can adjust the settings to make sure Comet is not sending your search data or using your data to improve the product and also block sensitive sites access like bank accounts and client portals.

Second, which is my top recommendation, is to create a completely separate Google account and only use it for non-sensitive tasks. I know it's not ideal, but this way you can ensure complete data isolation.

From a technical security standpoint, Srinivas addresses these concerns: "Security wise, we are very clear that none of the data is violating the SOC two compliance. So as a company, we are SOC two type two compliant, and we just try to ensure that all the data is securely stored and logged well."

Importantly, Comet is designed with privacy in mind for browsing history. As Srinivas explains, "All that history stays locally on your device, on your client. It doesn't actually get sent to the servers. But anytime you ask Comet to do something, it tries to understand you by pulling your browser history."

The Perplexity CEO has said they're going to track everything users do in their browser to sell hyperpersonalized ads. That doesn't feel great. And I'll be honest, I'm not going to do my online banking through Perplexity Comet right now.

But as of right now, the value it provides being able to do the things it does and save me time across many tasks, it's worth it for me to just do those specific things, even if it's just clicking publish in Apple Podcasts and maybe finding me a couple YouTube videos.

I would love to see other browsers like DIA or maybe tighter integration with Google Gemini and Chrome, although not crazy about using Chrome either. But one thing I would really love is for Apple to maybe build more intelligence into Safari, but I think we're really far away from that.

## The Future of AI Browsers

What we're seeing with Comet represents a fundamental shift in how we interact with the web. As Srinivas puts it, "The future is AIs that are just doing work for you, even as you sleep, without you even asking for it." We're moving toward what he calls "asynchronous multitasking abilities" - AI that works in the background rather than just responding synchronously in a chat window.

This paradigm shift means AI will be "auto drafting your responses to emails that were sent while you were not even active on your device. It's scheduling your meetings on your behalf and moving things around even without you asking for it. And it's prioritizing your emails that are sent to you."

The key insight is that effective AI assistance requires the same capabilities we expect from human assistants - the ability to use all the tools and resources available on the internet. "AI is clearly going to only deliver value as an end-to-end, orchestrated system that knows how to use the browser, how to upload files, how to download them, how to pull context from relevant tools and data that's only relevant to you and nobody else."

## The Bottom Line

After a full week with Perplexity Comet, I can confidently say it's changed how I use my Mac. The ability to automate tasks, find information quickly, and take action on websites makes it an invaluable tool in my workflow. While there are privacy concerns to consider, the productivity gains are significant enough that I'm incorporating it into my daily routine for specific tasks.

Whether you're looking to streamline your shopping with automatic promo code testing, enhance your YouTube research capabilities, automate repetitive tasks like publishing podcasts, conduct competitive intelligence, manage lead generation, or handle complex research projects, Comet offers capabilities that simply aren't available in traditional browsers.

The range of agent-like capabilities - from analyzing competitor websites across multiple tabs to automatically updating databases with the latest news, from sourcing qualified leads on Reddit to preparing meeting briefs from your calendar - shows how AI browsers are evolving beyond simple search into true productivity tools.

While I still use Safari by default and have all the Safari profiles and tab groups there, I'm using Comet more and more, especially knowing it can do all this for me. It's not perfect, and it's not
